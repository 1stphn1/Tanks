# tanks
🎮 A tank game made with C++ and SDL2

🖥️ The resolution is set to 1920x1080

🤷‍♂️ For some reason, barrel calculations are inaccurate, so barrels tend to move around a bit

🐖 Please let me know if you see any issue. Also, I'd like if you could rate my code, since I'm new to programming

😁 Thanks in advance


⌨️ Controls:
* ⬆️ to move the barrel upwards
* ⬇️ to move the barrel downwards
* ➡️ to move the tank to the right
* ⬅️ to move the tank to the left
* 🌌 to fire
