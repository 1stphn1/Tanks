# tanks
🎮 A tank game made with C++ and SDL2

🖥️ The resolution is set to 1920x1080

🤷‍♂️ For some reason, barrel calculations are not accurate, so barrels tend to move around a little bit

🐖 Please let me know if you see the issue. Also, I'd also like if you could rate my code, since I am new to programming

😁 Thanks in advance
